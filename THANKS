The Zee maintainers would like to thank all those who worked on GNU
Zile, from which Zee is derived.

In particular:

* Gary Vaughan <gary@gnu.org> contributed to the Lua version of Zile,
  from which Zee was directly adapted.

* Alistair Turnbull <apt1002@mupsych.org> contributed to the C version
  of Zee, from which code was directly translated for Lua Zee.
