               Zee build and installation instructions
               ---------------------------------------

To build and install Zee:

0) If you're building from CVS sources,

	autoreconf -i

1) Run configure:

	./configure

On many systems, you'll need to tell configure how to find Lua; the
following works on Debian:

	./configure --with-lua-includes=/usr/include/lua5.1 --with-lua-suffix=5.1

2) Compile the sources:

	make

2a) To try zee without installing it, just run it: 

	src/zee

3) To install zee, run

	make install

   By default, zee is installed under /usr/local (and hence requires
   root privileges); this can be changed by using the --prefix
   argument to configure.


Options
-------

If you are debugging the editor, you can enable the debugging code:

	./configure --enable-debug

For other configure options, run

	./configure --help


Note to developers
------------------

"make distcheck" needs the same options for finding Lua as configure.
The configure line above becomes:

	make DISTCHECK_CONFIGURE_FLAGS="--with-lua-includes=/usr/include/lua5.1 --with-lua-suffix=5.1" distcheck
