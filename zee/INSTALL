               Zee build and installation instructions
               ----------------------------------------

Special note for Cygwin users: If you are trying compiling Zee with
cygwin, please read question 3.3 of the FAQ (found in the `etc'
subdirectory).


To build zee:

1) Run configure:

	./configure

2) Compile the sources:

	make

3a) To install zee, run

	make install

   By default, zee is installed under /usr/local; this can be changed
   by using the --prefix argument to configure.

3b) If you just want to try zee, edit the `src/paths.h' file: replace
   the line

	#define PATH_DATA "/usr/local/share/zee"

   by

	#define PATH_DATA "/zee_src_dir/etc/zee"

   where `zee_src_dir' is the absolute directory where you unpacked the
   Zee sources.

4b) Recompile the sources:

	make

5b) To try zee, run it: 

	src/zee


Options
-------

If you are debugging the editor, you can enable the debugging code:

  --enable-debug          include debugging code and assertions

For other configure options, run

	 ./configure --help


Changing key bindings
---------------------

If you would like to change some key bindings of Zee, you need to
edit the `src/tbl_funcs.h' file. Maybe in the future a feature for
rebinding a function at run-time will be available.
