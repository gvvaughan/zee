Zee is an experimental editor and programming environment, hosted on
SourceForge at http://sourceforge.net/projects/zee/. It is free
software, licensed under the GNU GPL.

Zee is written in POSIX C and requires the Boehm garbage collector
(libgc), PCRE (the Perl-compatible regular expressions library), and a
terminal library (either ncurses or Allegro).

See INSTALL for installation instructions.

Any questions, comments, or bug reports should be sent to rrt@sc3d.org.
