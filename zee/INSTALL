               Zee build and installation instructions
               ---------------------------------------

To build zee:

1) Run configure:

	./configure

2) Compile the sources:

	make

3a) To install zee, run

	make install

   By default, zee is installed under /usr/local (and hence requires
   root privileges); this can be changed by using the --prefix
   argument to configure.

3b) To try zee without installing it, just run it: 

	src/zee
