Zee is an experimental editor and programming environment, hosted on
SourceForge at http://sourceforge.net/projects/zee/. It is free
software, licensed under the GNU GPL.

Zee is written in ISO C99 for POSIX and requires the Boehm garbage
collector (libgc), PCRE (the Perl-compatible regular expressions
library), and a terminal library (either ncurses or Allegro).

See INSTALL for installation instructions.

Any questions, comments, or bug reports should be sent to
zee-devel@lists.sourceforge.net
