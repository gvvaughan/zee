               Zee build and installation instructions
               ---------------------------------------

To build and install Zee:

-1) If you're building from Subversion sources, make sure you have the
   GNU autotools and makeinfo installed, and

	autoreconf -i

0) To build Zee, you need:

   * a C99 compiler (GCC 4.0 or later should work; earlier versions may too)
   * POSIX libraries
   * the Boehm garbage collector (libgc)
   * Lua
   * PCRE (the Perl-compatible regular expressions library)
   * a terminal library: either ncurses or Allegro

1) Run configure:

	./configure

On many systems, you'll need to tell configure how to find Lua; the
following works on Debian 4.0 and later:

	./configure --with-lua-includes=/usr/include/lua5.1 --with-lua-suffix=5.1

2) Compile the sources:

	make

2a) To try zee without installing it, just run it: 

	src/zee

3) To install zee, run

	make install

   By default, zee is installed under /usr/local (and hence requires
   root privileges); this can be changed by using the --prefix
   argument to configure.


Options
-------

If you are debugging the editor, you can enable the debugging code:

	./configure --enable-debug

For other configure options, run

	./configure --help


Note to developers
------------------

"make distcheck" needs the same options for finding Lua as configure.
For the Debian example above, you would run:

	make DISTCHECK_CONFIGURE_FLAGS="--with-lua-includes=/usr/include/lua5.1 --with-lua-suffix=5.1" distcheck
