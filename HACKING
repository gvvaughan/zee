Coding style
------------

Rather than attempt an exhaustive list, the following points address
just FDQs (Frequently Discussed Questions).

0. Follow the style of existing code. Consistency is more important
than any particular element of style.

1. Avoid reversed comparisons. Arguably a good idea in C, but in Lua
"if a = 0 then..." is a syntax error, so there's no need to inflict
"if 0 == a then..." on those who don't like that style.

2. Put space around operators and variables: "for i = 0, #t", not
"for i=0,#t". The latter is cramped and harder to read.

3. Use one-line conditionals sparingly. As a rule of thumb, only use
them when the entire line is shorter than 70 characters. Their use is
encouraged in code of the form "if CONDITION then return end", and a
one-line "if...then...else...end" may often be superior to the
quasi-ternary operator "x and a or b" (where if "a" can be false
results in "b").


Making a release
----------------

To make a release you need woger, from
http://rrt.sc3d.org/Software/woger and the dependencies it lists for
releasing on Github and Freecode.

* Write the release notes in release-notes-$VERSION

* Run:

    make release
