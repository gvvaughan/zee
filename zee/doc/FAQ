1. General questions

1.1. What does `Zee' mean?

    Nothing. It sounds like `Zi', which is the name I wanted (to show
    its descent from Zile). SourceForge doesn't allow two-letter
    names, so I chose `Zee' instead, which can be pronounced the same.

1.2. Zee doesn't compile.

    Zee should work on any POSIX-compliant OS that supports termcap or
    Allegro. If you get Zee running a non-POSIX OS, please tell us and
    send us the necessary patches.

1.3. Zee is weird!

    Zee was written to be as small and simple as possible. If you
    don't like it, it might be because it doesn't work the way you're
    used to, or it may have been badly designed. If after trying it
    for a bit you still don't like the way it works, please tell us
    what you don't like (see the README for the address).


2. Functionality

2.1. How do I return to the shell without leaving Zee?

    Type `Alt-X file_suspend RETURN'.

2.2. How do I undo the previous command?

    Type Ctrl-Z (or `Alt-X edit_undo RETURN').

2.3. How do I handle non-ASCII characters?

    Zee uses the operating system's locale support, so you need to set
    an appropriate locale. How you do this depends on your OS.
    However, Zee only works with 8-bit locales at present; support for
    Unicode/UTF-8 is planned.
