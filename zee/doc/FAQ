1. General questions

1.1. What does `Zee' mean?

    Nothing. It sounds like `Zi', which is the name I wanted (to show
    its descent from Zile). SourceForge doesn't allow two-letter
    names, so I chose `Zee' instead, which can be pronounced the same.

1.2. What is Zee's license?

    Zee is released under the GNU General Public License. For more
    information, see http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html.

1.3. Where can I get the latest version?

    The Zee project is hosted on SourceForge at:

	http://zee.sourceforge.net/

1.4. Zee has a bug!

    Bug reports can be sent to the authors at
    zee-devel@lists.sourceforge.net or entered directly into Bugzilla
    at http://sourceforge.net/projects/zee. Patches are appreciated.

1.5. Zee is weird!

    Zee was written to be as small and simple as possible. If you
    don't like it, it might be because it doesn't work the way you're
    used to, or I may have been badly designed. If after trying it for
    a bit you still don't like the way it works, complain!

1.6. Zee doesn't compile.

    We have tested Zee under GNU/Linux only (other than the EPOC
    port), although it should work on any POSIX-compliant OS that
    supports termcap or Allegro. If you get Zee running under an OS
    not listed here, please send a message to the developers telling
    them that (you might also send any patches you have made to the
    sources if you want them included in the next release).

2. Functionality

2.1. How do I quit Zee?

    Type `C-q'.

2.2. How do I return to the shell without leaving Zee?

    Type `M-x suspend'.

2.3. How do I undo the previous command?

    Type `C-z'.

2.4. What does `C-something' or `M-something' mean?

    From the tutorial:

    C-<chr> means hold the CONTROL key while typing the character
	     <chr> Thus, `C-f' would be: hold the CONTROL key and type
	     `f'.
    M-<chr> means hold the META or EDIT or ALT key down while typing
	     <chr>. If there is no META, EDIT or ALT key, instead
	     press and release the ESC key and then type <chr>. We
	     write <ESC> for the ESC key.

2.5. What settings can I change?

    Check out the `dotzee.sample' file for a full list of variables.

2.6. How do I handle non-ASCII characters?

    Zee uses the operating system's locale support, so you need to set
    an appropriate locale. How you do this depends on your OS.
    However, Zee only works with 8-bit locales at present; support for
    Unicode/UTF-8 is planned.
